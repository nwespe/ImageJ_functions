# ImageJ_functions
ImageJ macros for segmenting and organizing image files of dilution series spots on agar plates.

This is a collection of FIJI (ImageJ) macros for various analyses of yeast growing on agar plates. 
For in-depth descriptions of the functions, see the ImageJ Macros PDF. The 'colony counter' assists in counting colonies. 
The 'frogger splitter' files divide the series of spots created by a frogger tool into separate files, 
and the strain_sorter.py and strain_report.py programs sort and compile these files by the strain and condition.
The 'HU survival' files use the spot image files to compare growth of strains before and after drug treatment.

The 'bud detector' files analyze microscopy images of budding yeast to assist in budding index calculation. 
This program is not completed and is not described in the PDF.
