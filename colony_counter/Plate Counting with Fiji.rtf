Plate counting with Fiji (is just ImageJ)

1. Take images of plates (agar up!) with trans-illuminating white light.
[Settings used on Gel-Doc: aperture = 8.00, zoom = 25, focus = 2.0, exposure = 75 ms]
2. Run "auto count" from Plugins folder. Select folder containing plate images.
3. Run "manual count" from Plugins folder, selecting same folder as in step 2.
4. Click on unmarked colonies, typically around the edge of the plate.
5. Colony counts (auto, manual, and total) are saved in a text file in the folder selected in steps 2 and 3.
